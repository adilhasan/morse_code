# morse_code
## A little rust program to read in a text message and encode into morse code

This little program reads in text message from the command line, encodes into Morse code, plays the message and prints out the message in morse code. The morse dash and dot sounds are read from mp3 files and the morse code book for the alphabetic letters is stored in a JSON file.

### How to run the program:
1. Make sure you have Rust installed (see: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Download the source code from git.
3. Build the code with:
```cargo build```
4. Run the code:
```cargo run```
you will then be prompted to enter a message to encode.
